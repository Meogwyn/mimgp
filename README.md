# MIMGP - Multiplicative Integral Modular Group Printer

Note: I don't care whether 'modular group' is a term that corresponds to the
meaning I have in mind in this project.

## Description

A program to perform some basic operations in multiplactive groups if integers
modulo n, and print the results.

## Functionality

* Performs calculations of products, powers, inverses, etc.
* Prints group tables
